# 📊 Passenger Experience & Operational Intelligence (Power BI & DAX)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project synthesizes **129,880+ global passenger records** into a strategic "Command Centre" to diagnose brand health and operational efficiency. The goal is to identify the mathematical **"Breaking Point"** of service delivery, evaluate the **"Frustration Carry-over"** effect, and isolate high-impact opportunities for **revenue recovery and service revitalization**.

**Key metrics analyzed:**
- **Overall Satisfaction Rate (%)**  
- **30-Minute Operational Redflag (Delay Impact)**
- **Service Influence Gap (Satisfied vs. Dissatisfied)**
- **Revenue per Available Seat Kilometer (RASK)**

## 🔍 Key Analyses
- **Sentiment Decay Mapping:** Identified the 30-minute threshold where passenger trust and repeat-booking intent collapse.
- **Service Influence Analysis:** Ranked 14 service dimensions (WiFi, Booking, Gate, etc.) to distinguish between "Basic Needs" and "Loyalty Drivers."
- **Customer Segmentation:** Evaluated satisfaction gaps across **Business vs. Economy** and **Loyal vs. First-time** travelers.
- **Operational Friction Audit:** Isolated the "Bottom 5" departments causing the highest negative impact on brand equity.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills
- **Power BI:** Advanced Data Modeling, Star Schema, Slicer Synchronization.
- **Power Query:** "Magic Unpivot" logic, Text Scrubbing, Hybrid Date Reconciliation.
- **DAX:** Calculated Measures for Satisfaction Decay, Weighted CSAT, and Percentage Variances.
- **Analytical Strategy:** Root Cause Analysis, Sentiment Psychology, Revenue Architecture.

## 📈 Key Insights
- **The 30-Minute Breaking Point:** Beyond 30 minutes of departure delay, satisfaction scores crash by 25%, indicating a critical operational limit.
- **Ground-to-Cabin Friction:** Poor digital experiences (Online Booking/WiFi) create a "negative lens" that diminishes the perceived value of the actual flight.
- **Economy Emergency:** Identified an **81.54% dissatisfaction rate** in the Economy segment, signaling a massive risk to the airline's highest-volume revenue base.

## ✅ Outcome
A high-fidelity, board-ready **Decision-Support System** that converts 130k rows of raw sentiment into a **₦10,000,000 monthly revenue recovery roadmap**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Engineer a **Sentiment Decay Model** to visualize the impact of logistical delays.
- Isolate the **Top 5 Service Failures** driving customer churn.
- Provide a **Segmentation Strategy** to protect the 106,100 Returning Passenger base.
- Build an interactive **Multi-Page Command Centre** for executive-level tactical planning.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used
- **Power BI Desktop:** Star Schema modeling, cross-report filtering, and tooltip integration.
- **Advanced DAX:** `DIVIDE`, `CALCULATE`, `FILTER`, and Ranking functions.
- **Power Query (M):** Unpivoting attribute columns to create a dynamic "Service Matrix."
- **Data Visualization:** High-contrast design (Dark Blue vs. Light Red) for 3-second insight delivery.

## 📊 Key Performance Metrics

### **Service Performance & Influence**

- **Net Satisfaction Rate:** The primary pulse of the Dana Air brand.
- **Influence Gap:** The spread between how satisfied vs. dissatisfied passengers rate specific touchpoints.
- **Bottom 5 Service Ratings:** Identifying the "Operational Weak Links."

### **Customer Segmentation & Loyalty**

- **Proportional Satisfaction by Class:** Comparing Business, Economy, and Eco-Plus performance.
- **Loyalty Retention:** Measuring the volume and sentiment of the **106,100 Returning Passengers** vs. First-time acquisitions.

### **Operational Delay Analysis**
- **Satisfaction Decay Trend:** Visualizing the drop in sentiment as departure delays increase.
- **30-Minute Redflag Status:** Tracking flights that exceed the acceptable customer-patience window.


## 🔍 Detailed Strategic Insights

### **The "Frustration Carry-over" Effect**
- Data confirms that a poor digital experience (Online Booking/WiFi) acts as a **"negative lens."** Passengers frustrated at the start of the journey are significantly less likely to rate in-flight catering or seat comfort highly, regardless of actual quality.

### **The 30-Minute Operational Redflag**
- Analysis of 130k records mathematically isolates **30 minutes** as the "Breaking Point." Beyond this mark, the probability of a passenger remaining "Satisfied" drops to nearly zero, regardless of seating class.

### **Economy Class Emergency**
- With **8 out of 10 Economy passengers** reporting dissatisfaction, the airline’s largest revenue base is at high risk. The data suggests that "Ground-to-Cabin" friction is the primary driver, rather than the flight itself.


## 📝 How to Use the Command Centre

1. **Brand Health Overview:**  
   - Use the **Satisfaction Rate KPI Card** for an instant pulse check on the 129,880 records.
2. **Identifying Weak Links:**  
   - Review the **Bottom 5 Services** chart to see which departments require immediate Capex or training interventions.
3. **Strategic Drill-Down:**  
   - Use the **Class and Travel Type Slicers** to filter the entire dashboard. Compare Business vs. Economy to see where the "Value Gap" is widest.
4. **Managing the Redflag:**  
   - Use the **Delay Impact Scatter Plot** to analyze specific routes and the exact minute where customer trust begins to decay.
